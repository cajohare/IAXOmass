# IAXOmass
Code for reproducing results from arXiv:[1811.?????] on how IAXO can use the energy dependence of the X-ray spectrum from Solar axion conversion to measure the axion mass over a small range when the discrimination is not destroyed by oscillations.

The code is written in python, and all the plots are generated using jupyter notebooks. This repository contains all the code needed to reproduce the paper.

The axion parameter space g-m_a. The main result of this paper is shown as a blue region: the median range of masses and couplings for which IAXO can determine the axion mass to be non-zero with 3sigma significance. The QCD axion band is shaded in orange and the common benchmark KSVZ and DFSZ models are drawn as straight brown lines. In various shades of green are axions excluded by astrophysical arguments. The best experimental results shown in shades of red. All the limit data can be found in the 'limit_data' folder
