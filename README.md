# IAXOmass
Code for reproducing results from arXiv:[1811.?????] on how IAXO can use the energy dependence of the X-ray spectrum from Solar axion conversion to measure the axion mass over a small range when the discrimination is not destroyed by oscillations.

The code is written in python, and all the plots are generated using jupyter notebooks. This repository contains all the code needed to reproduce the paper.
